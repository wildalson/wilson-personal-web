Quick Start

#Install dependencies for the server and client
npm run init

#After installing the dependencies, you may run the client and server concurrently by running the command
npm run dev

#Do note that the server is running on port 5000 where as the client on port 3000

#Currently starting out as a software developer, and any feedback from any experienced developer would be appreciated! Thanks.
